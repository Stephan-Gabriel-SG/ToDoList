**ToDo-N** is a simple to-do list application that allows users to create projects, add tasks to these projects, and manage them efficiently. Tasks can be marked as completed, deleted, or edited, and they are associated with a project. The app also has specific sections for "Today", "Overdue", and "Completed tasks". The data is stored in **localStorage**, ensuring that tasks and projects are preserved even after the page is reloaded.
